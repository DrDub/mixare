*The follwing tutorial applies for mixare v0.8 and above*

=Importing and compiling the project=

Once you forked or cloned the project from github, you can start importing mixare in your workspace.
Since version 0.8 mixare contains 2 parts. The core part and the library (mixarelib) part.  

In order to successfully import the mixare project into your workspace, you need to import the library of mixare. The library can be found in _plugins/mixarelib_

----

You first have to import both the mixare and the mixarelib into your workspace.

After you added both projects, you have to convert mixarelib into a android library project, you can do that by richtclicking on the mixarelib -> go to properties -> select android -> scroll down -> and then check the "is Libary" checkbox.

Then rightclick on the mixare project -> go to properties -> select android -> scroll down -> and then add the mixarelib as the project library.

Good luck
